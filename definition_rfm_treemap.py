    st.markdown("""
    The **Customer Segmentation Treemap** visually represents your patient base based on their **RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) scores**, grouping them into **three key customer categories**:

    1. **Customers to Concern** ‚Äì Low-value, inactive patients who may not be worth significant retention efforts.  
    2. **Customers to Retain** ‚Äì Your most valuable and engaged patients who should be prioritized.  
    3. **Customers to Improve** ‚Äì Patients with potential for growth and engagement.  

    This segmentation **helps prioritize efforts** by highlighting which patients are worth focusing on, which require improvement, and which are unlikely to contribute significantly to your clinic's success.

    These patients have **low engagement, low spending, and infrequent visits**.

    - **Less Valuable Customers**  
    - Patients with **RFM scores lower than 3 for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary**.  
    - They may visit occasionally but don‚Äôt contribute significantly.

    - **Lost Customers**  
    - Patients with **Recency = 1, Frequency = 4, and Monetary = 4**.  
    - **They were once valuable but haven‚Äôt returned in a long time.**  
    - A large number of Lost Customers **suggests a problem with patient retention.**  

    - **Lost Cheap Customers**  
    - Patients with the **lowest RFM scores (1,1,1)**.

    - **Assess Patient Distribution**

    - **Engage Moderate Customers** with targeted campaigns to improve frequency and spending.  
    - **Limit focus on Lost Cheap Customers**, as reactivation efforts may not be cost-effective.
